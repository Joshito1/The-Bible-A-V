# Source Code Distribution

SCD Branch is used for Saving, Backup, Distribution and Contribution of Source Code within Developers Development Space.

### Committing Message Convention:
`<Date> <Receive From Who & What> <Branch From / To> <Working On - Subject Push Count>`

_**Example:**_ `52225 John Laptop main>SCD JS Logic SP3` <br/><br/>

### Extended Description Ideas: (Recommended for organizational purposes)
If you are intending to keep SCD Branch up to date and/or haven't completed coding, here are some things that you could optionally type into Extended Description;
- Changes made.
- Changes to make, reminders for later; that is, for a fix or a To Do later, etc.\
  &
- Anything extra or just in particular that you think should be noted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please Keep SCD Branch up to date with any changes from website code (even if not complete). This should prevent any future problems. Thank you :heart:
